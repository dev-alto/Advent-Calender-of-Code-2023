# ☃️ My Advent of Code Escapade

My attempts at becoming a Holly Jolly Christmas programming hero.

I try my best to clean up before pushing on here; I also leave a lot of my thought processes through comments.

Each day contains the inputs I am given + each puzzle variant example's inputs; also has code iterations for both puzzles.

- Want to become a Holly Jolly programming hero too? Or do you just want to experiment and have fun?
- Don't be shy, join the holiday fun here: https://adventofcode.com/.
